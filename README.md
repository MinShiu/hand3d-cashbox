# Cashbox Detector

<p> This repo is a forked from https://github.com/lmb-freiburg/hand3d, and I repack it to use as an algorithm to detect open or close of cashbox. Besides of detection, it has a simple UI that required installation of PyQt5. However, everything is customize based on my camera. Edit the variables in <code>Cashbox.py</code> to fit in your case.</p>

<p> Run the application with <code>python Main.py</code> </p>
